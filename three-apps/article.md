# How I Built a PWA, an iOS App, and an Android App in a Weekâ€”From One Codebase

One of my favorite things about being a software developer is being able to take a simple idea and turn it into a useful app.

Last month, a problem keep coming up in my local PokÃ©mon GO group (yes, the game is [alive and well](https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/07/09/pokemon-go-revenue-2018/) ðŸ™‚)â€”people kept manually sharing a checklist image that looks a little something like this.

The software developer in me couldnâ€™t handle the thought of so many people doing a manual task, so I decided to build ShinyDex, a dead-simple checklist app, and I deployed the app to both Google Play and the web. The app on Google Play already has over 5,000 installs and 50 reviews.

In this article Iâ€™m going to show you how I used the recently announced [NativeScript and Angular integration](https://blog.angular.io/apps-that-work-natively-on-the-web-and-mobile-9b26852495e7) to get all three of these apps out quickly. Iâ€™ll walk you through the same process I went through, and give you some tips and tricks for things I hit along the way.
