# NativeScript Supports Angular 4

Last week, the Angular team [released Angular 4.0.0](http://angularjs.blogspot.com/2017/03/angular-400-now-available.html), and today weâ€™re happy to announce that NativeScript now support this latest update ðŸŽ‰

Angular 4 brings smaller application packages and faster runtime speeds. Letâ€™s look at how you can update your NativeScript apps to take advantage of these optimizations.

## Updating

To get the update youâ€™ll need to update a few dependencies in your `package.json` file. Hereâ€™s what a typical update will look like.

A couple notes about the changes above.

* The main update here is bumping the `nativescript-angular` package to version 1.5.0, and the various Angular packages to 4.0.0. Note that the `@angular/router` package moved from 3.x to 4.x, rather than 2.x to 4.x. Synching the version numbers of these packages is the reason that the Angular team went from Angular 2 to Angular 4.
* With Angular 4 the various animation libraries now live in their own package, `@angular/animations`. This package is optional, so you only need to depend on it if you intend to use Angular animations in your app. (Note that thereâ€™s one extra step youâ€™ll need to take to use Angular animations in your NativeScript apps because of this changeâ€”more on that in a minute.)
* The `zone.js` dependency package should now be listed as a dependency rather than a devDependency. This is to resolve some rather arcance npm peer dependency issues to make these various packages play nice together.
* Notice that the TypeScript version remains specified as `~2.1.0`. This is important, as **NativeScript with Angular doesnâ€™t support TypeScript 2.2 quite yet**. Support is coming in our upcoming NativeScript 3.0 release, which you can a release candidate for very soon ðŸ˜„

## Breaking changes

When you do update your packages there are two trivial breaking changes you should be aware of. First, the path to the `NativeScriptModule` class has changed. Youâ€™ll likely be using this only in your `app.module.ts` file, so it should be a quick update.

Before:

```
import { NativeScriptModule } from "nativescript-angular/platform";
```

After:

```
import { NativeScriptModule } from "nativescript-angular/nativescript.module";
```

Second, to use Angular animations in NativeScript, you now need to import the `NativeScriptAnimationsModule` from `"nativescript-angular/animations"` in your root `NgModule`. This works exactly like the `NativeScriptFormsModule`, `NativeScriptHttpModule`, and `NativeScriptRouterModule` classes that you are likely already using. As an example:

```
import { NativeScriptModule } from "nativescript-angular/nativescript.module";
import { NativeScriptAnimationsModule } from "nativescript-angular/animations";
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";

import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NativeScriptModule,
    NativeScriptAnimationsModule
  ],
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

> **NOTE**: Make sure that when using Angular animations youâ€™re also including the `@angular/animations` dependency in your `package.json` file, and the previous example showed.

## Final notes

Oh one last thing: the Angular team deprecated `<template>` in favor of `<ng-template>`, so youâ€™re almost certainly going to get this warning when you go to run your apps.

```
The <template> element is deprecated. Use <ng-template> instead.
```

The fix is as simple as updating your `<template>` tags to `<ng-template>` throughout your app. 

And thatâ€™s really it. For most users the upgrade to Angular 4 should be seamless.
