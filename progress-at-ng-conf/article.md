Our live blog is a great way to follow along with the ng-conf keynote if you canâ€™t be at the event itself. Jen Looper, Sebastian Witalec, Tara Manicsic, and I will be at the event and sharing what we see in the room, and offering our perspectives on the future of Angular.

<h2 id="robot-session">Robot session ðŸ¤– (Thursday, April 6th)</h2>

Do you like robots? Great! On April 6th, day two of ng-conf, Sebastian Witalec will be demonstrating how to build a robot army with [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/). The session is a great way to get up to speed on using bluetooth on the web and in NativeScript apps.

The party starts at 7:00 PM (Salt Lake City time), so make sure to join us if youâ€™re attending the event.

<h2 id="emoji-session">Emoji session ðŸ˜Ž (Friday, April 7th)</h2>

What could be better than robots and a rave party? Emoji!

On April 7th, day three of ng-conf, Jen Looper, Tara Manicsic, and I will be demonstrating how to create a real-time cross-platform emoji service. Weâ€™ll be showing off [how to use Angular in Kendo UI](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/), how to build robust charts and graphs, and how to use Firebase to make everything update in real-time.

Plus, we promised costumes for this one, so you wonâ€™t want to miss that.

<h2 id="our-booth">Our booth ðŸŽ‰</h2>

Weâ€™re going to have a booth at ng-conf again this year, and if last year is any indication out booth is a pretty hip place to be. Stop by and say hi, and pick up some swag for your favorite Progress products.

<h2 id="meet-us">Meet us ðŸ‘‹</h2>

And finally, a number of us from Progress will be at the event, including several members of the NativeScript and Kendo UI teams. Weâ€™d love to chat about NativeScript, Kendo UI, Angular, or whatever.
