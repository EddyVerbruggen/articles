# One project. One language. Three apps.

Itâ€™s 2018 and weâ€™ve achieved the dream: [robots that make phone calls for us](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17332070/google-assistant-makes-phone-call-demo-duplex-io-2018). Oh, and we can also use JavaScript to build apps for basically any platform. Thatâ€™s probably the more relevant dream.

And because JavaScript can be used to create apps on virtually any platform, developers have created a variety of projects that let you build for the web, for iOS, and for Androidâ€”AT THE SAME TIME ðŸ˜®

Want to learn more? [**Join us on Thursday, December 6th at 11:00 AM EST**](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/1129877235012219907) as we look at how to build for multiple platforms in detail.

In this free online webinar youâ€™ll learn about:

* **NativeScript and React Native**, both of which have the ability to build web apps, native iOS apps, and native Android apps, simultaneously.
* **Best practices**, especially when deciding when to build for multiple platforms.
* **How to get started**, and specifically how to get started using NativeScript Schematics and React Native Web. Youâ€™ll watch the same app built twice so you can compare and contrast the two approaches.
