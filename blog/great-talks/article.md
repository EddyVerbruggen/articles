# How to Write and Deliver a Great Conference Talk

Over the last seven years Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to deliver [several dozen talks](https://www.tjvantoll.com/speaking/) at locations around the world.

Through trial and error (and omg lots of error), Iâ€™ve learned a number of tips and tricks when it comes to both preparing, as well as delivering a quality technical talk.

# Is Augmented Reality the Future?

* Brief history of AR
* AR today
* Building AR apps
```

Humans like when you break a concept into sections. Itâ€™s the reason [listicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listicle) work in blog posts (like this very one youâ€™re reading now ðŸ˜‰ ), and the same works for talks as well.

Creating a simple outline like this can serve as a good litmus test as to whether you should create a talk in the first place. That is, if youâ€™re having trouble coming up with a small handful of high-level topics you want to cover, thatâ€™s sometimes a sign that you donâ€™t have a compelling talk topic.

The other good thing about having an outline
