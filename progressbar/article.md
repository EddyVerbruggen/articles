# Building a Simple Progressbar for your NativeScript App

Progressbars are a common user interface component regardless of development platform. For example hereâ€™s what Bootstrapâ€™s progressbar component looks like.

In this article weâ€™ll look at how you can easily recreate this UI component for your NativeScript apps, and learn a bit about NativeScriptâ€™s layout system in the process.

## Progressbar markup

To create a simple progressbar you only need two components, a `<GridLayout>` to use as the bar itself, and a `<StackLayout>` to serve as the filled-in portion of the bar.

``` XML
<GridLayout columns="3*, *" class="progressbar">
  <StackLayout col="0" class="progressbar-value"></StackLayout>
</GridLayout>
```

The key thing driving this example is the `GridLayout`â€™s `columns` attribute, but weâ€™ll come back to that in a minute. First, so that you can get a visual of what this looks like, letâ€™s add in a bit of CSS to make this markup look like a progressbar.

``` CSS
.progressbar {
    height: 50;
    margin: 10;
    border-radius: 10;
    border-color: black;
    border-width: 1;
}
.progressbar-value {
    background: #337ab7;
}
```

With that CSS in place you should have a progressbar that looks like this.

If you have more design talent than me you might want to play with different colors, and maybe even experiment with [NativeScriptâ€™s new support for linear gradient backgrounds](https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/ns-ui-widgets/styling#gradients).

Just to give you an idea of whatâ€™s possible, hereâ€™s a slightly different look for the same progressbar with a bit of alternative CSS.

``` CSS
.progressbar {
    height: 30;
    margin: 10;
    border-radius: 10;
    background: #ECEFF1;
}
.progressbar-value {
    background: #51BC6B;
}
```

Regardless of how you choose to style your progressbar, the next thing you need to do is come up with a way of controlling the barâ€™s width. Letâ€™s look at how to do that.

## Progressbar logic

To explain how this is going to work, letâ€™s return to this exampleâ€™s markup.

``` XML
<GridLayout columns="3*, *" class="progressbar">
  <StackLayout col="0" class="progressbar-value"></StackLayout>
</GridLayout>
```

In this example, the `GridLayout` specifies two columns, one with a width of `3*`, and another with a width of `*`. This creates four units of width, and assigns three to the first column, and one to the second. This is why the bar takes up 75% of the overall width in our example.

To make this width dynamic, all you need to do is dynamically assign that width in JavaScript or TypeScript. Using Angular, that code looks a little something like this.

``` XML
<GridLayout [columns]="columns" class="progressbar">
  <StackLayout col="0" class="progressbar-value"></StackLayout>
</GridLayout>
```

``` TypeScript
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
    ...
})
export class ItemsComponent implements OnInit {
  columns;

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.setProgressbarWidth(20);
  }
}

  setProgressbarWidth(percent) {
    this.columns = percent + "*," + (100 - percent) + "*";
  }
}
```

Here, you bind the `columns` attribute of the `GridLayout` to a `columns` property in your Angular component.

In the component, you also define a `setProgressbarWidth()` method, which takes a 0â€“100 integer and sets the attribute to appropriate value.

> **NOTE**: If youâ€™re confused by exactly what `setProgressbarWidth()` does try running through the logic with a few specific values. For example, if you pass in `70` the method sets the `columns` property to `70*,30*`; if you pass in `50` the method sets the `columns` property to `50*,50*`.

With this code you can now easily use TypeScript code to set the progressbarâ€™s width to a percentage width. For example, the code above renders a progressbar that looks like this.

To make the progressbar move all you need to do is call `setProgressbarWidth()` with a new value. For example, the following code moves a progressbar from 0â€“100.

``` TypeScript
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  ..
})
export class ItemsComponent implements OnInit {
  columns;

  ngOnInit(): void {
    let percent = 0;
    let intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      this.setProgressbarWidth(percent);
      percent++;
      if (percent > 100) {
        clearInterval(intervalId);
      }
    }, 50);
  }

  setProgressbarWidth(percent) {
    this.columns = percent + "*," + (100 - percent) + "*";
  }
}
```

## Wrapping up

Hopefully this article has given you an idea of how you can implement progressbars in your own apps, and maybe even a little bit about how NativeScriptâ€™s GridLayout works.

Feel free to tinker with this exampleâ€™s code if youâ€™re looking to do something a bit more custom, and if you come up with something cool, make sure to post it in the comments ðŸ™‚
