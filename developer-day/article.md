NativeScript Developer Day is a 2-day event with content for both seasoned and novice mobile developers.

The first day features [a series of deep dives](http://developerday.nativescript.org/#schedule) that give you the chance to learn about NativeScript from industry experts. We have already have deep dives on ES6, TypeScript, Angular, code sharing, and NativeScript plugins on the calendar—and we’ll have a few more to announce in the coming days.

The second day features 30-minute sessions from prominent members of the JavaScript and NativeScript communities, as well as from the NativeScript team. Learn how to optimize your app’s startup times, how to use native iOS and Android APIs, how to use the new Chrome DevTools integration, how to write effective tests, and a whole lot more.

## Networking opportunities

There’s never been a better chance to get to know the people NativeScript project. With NativeScript team members and community members flying in from around the country and around the world, Developer Day is a rare chance to interact with the people you normally only see in Slack channels and GitHub issues.
