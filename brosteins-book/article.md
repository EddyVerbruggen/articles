# A Chat with Mike and Nick Branstein—Authors of NativeScript in Action 

Last week I sat down and talked to Mike and Nick Branstein, authors of [NativeScript in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/nativescript-in-action?a_aid=nativescript&a_bid=ea1dc18b). In the video Mike and Nick talk about what got them started with NativeScript, what made them want to write a book, and what the experience of writing a tech book is like.

It’s an interesting conversation, especially if you’ve ever considered getting into writing a book yourself. The video is a quick 15-minute watch, so check it out!
