# Tutorial: Build a Production-Ready App with Kinvey Studio

Kinvey Studio is a rapid app development tool for building cross-platform applications with Kinvey. In this hands-on tutorial you’ll learn how to use Kinvey Studio by building an application that:

- **Connects to data**, whether that data resides in Kinvey, or in an existing data store such as Salesforce, SQL Server, or SAP.
- **Has a complete user management system**, including the ability to integrate with existing enterprise authentication providers such as Active Directory.
- **Includes a customizable chat experience** built on top of Kinvey’s powerful NativeChat technology.
- **Is built on open technologies**. Kinvey Studio apps are built on top of NativeScript and Angular, giving you the opportunity to extend your applications using well-known frameworks.

If you continue to the end of the tutorial you’ll have an app that runs on the web, and iOS, and on Android.
